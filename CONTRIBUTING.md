# Contributing to Seeds Soil Classification

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's issue tracker

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
